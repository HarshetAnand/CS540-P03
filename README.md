# CS540-P03

In this program, I built and simulated a simple Markov chain model based on a movie script. I used it to generate new sentences that hopefully contain sensible words maybe even phrases. In addition, I built a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish sentences from the script and sentences from another fake script. Due to the English vocabulary size, the characters are used as features instead of words.
