# CS540-P03 Text Generation - Markov Chain and Naive Bayes Classification

- In this program, we built and simulated a simple Markov chain model based on a movie script. We used it to generate new sentences that hopefully contain sensible words maybe even phrases. 
- In addition, we built a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish sentences from the script and sentences from another fake script. Due to the English vocabulary size, the characters are used as features instead of words.
